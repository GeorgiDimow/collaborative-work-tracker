# collaborative-work-tracker

Project Overview:
The Collaborative Work Tracker (CWT) project aims to identify pairs of employees who have worked together on common projects for the longest period.
The application calculates the number of days employees collaborated, considering the DateTo field (nullable, defaulting to today) and supporting multiple date formats.
Input data is loaded from a CSV file, and the application is built using React with clean code conventions.
